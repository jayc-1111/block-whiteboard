### 2025-08-17: CSS Variables Fully Removed (REFACTORED)
**Change:** Removed all remaining CSS variables and replaced them with direct values.

**Variables removed:**
- `--canvas-bg` → `#191919`
- `--toolbar-button-background` → `transparent`
- `--toolbar-button-background-hover` → `#5353ff`
- `--toolbar-button-text-color` → `#7e8590`
- `--grid-bg` → `#191919`
- `--grid-element-size` → `2000px`
- `--grid-spacing` → `27px`
- `--grid-dot-size` → `2px`
- `--bg-image` → Direct style.backgroundImage setting

**Files Modified:**
- `css/base/reset.css` - Replaced button and body variables
- `css/canvas/canvas.css` - Removed bg-image variable
- `css/canvas/grid.css` - Replaced grid variables
- `css/items/toolbar/toolbar.css` - Replaced toolbar button variables
- `css/themes/frutiger.css` - Replaced grid variables
- `css/themes/picnic.css` - Replaced grid variables
- `css/themes/lollipop.css` - Replaced grid variables
- `js/theme.js` - Changed from setProperty to direct style setting
- `index.html` - Removed variables.css and classes.css links

**Result:** CSS is now completely free of variables. All values are directly in their respective files.

---

### 2025-08-18: Theme Switching Not Working (FIXED)
**Problem:** Themes in customization menu couldn't be clicked on or switched to.

**Root Cause:** The `setupSettingsHandlers()` function that registers click events for theme options was defined but never called.

**Solution:** Added `setupSettingsHandlers()` call in the DOMContentLoaded event listener.

**Files Modified:**
- `js/hamburger-menu.js` - Called setupSettingsHandlers() on DOM ready

**Result:** Themes are now clickable and switch properly.

---

### 2025-08-17: Codebase-Wide Dropdown Styling Consistency (FIXED)
**Problem:** Dropdown styles were inconsistent across codebase - different files had different styling despite being similar components.

**Files with inconsistent dropdowns found:**
- toolbar.css - had wrong backgrounds, gaps, hover states
- whiteboard-switcher.css - had wrong backgrounds, gaps  
- file-tree-dropdown.css - completely different styling
- hamburger.css - had wrong gaps, hover states

**Solution:** Standardized ALL dropdowns to match hamburger menu:
- Container: background: #131313, border-radius: 12px, padding: 8px, gap: 4px, border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.05)
- Items: padding: 10px 12px, border-radius: 8px, gap: 12px
- Font: Nunito, 0.80rem, font-weight: 500, color: #ddd
- Hover: background: #2a2a2a, transform: translateX(2px)
- Light mode: #FFFFFF background, #E8EBF0 hover, #5c5c5c text

**Files Modified:**
- `css/items/toolbar/dropdowns.css`
- `css/items/toolbar/toolbar.css` 
- `css/items/toolbar/whiteboard-switcher.css`
- `css/items/toolbar/hamburger.css`
- `css/items/widget/file-tree-dropdown.css`

**Result:** All dropdowns now have identical, consistent styling across entire codebase.

---

### 2025-08-17: Dropdown Styling Consistency (FIXED)
**Problem:** Dropdowns had inconsistent styling - different padding, gaps, border-radius from hamburger menu.

**Solution:** Standardized all dropdowns to match hamburger menu:
- Container: border-radius: 12px, padding: 8px, gap: 4px, border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.05)
- Items: padding: 10px 12px, border-radius: 8px, gap: 12px
- Font: Nunito, 0.80rem, font-weight: 500
- Hover: background: #2a2a2a, transform: translateX(2px)
- Background: #131313 for all dropdowns

**Files Modified:**
- `css/items/toolbar/dropdowns.css` - Updated all dropdown styles

**Result:** All dropdowns now have consistent hamburger menu styling.

---

### 2025-08-17: Dropdown Hover Fix - Complete Solution (FIXED)
**Problem:** Dropdowns disappearing when cursor moves from trigger to dropdown, especially in light theme.

**Root Causes:**
1. Gap between trigger and dropdown (margin-top: 10px) broke hover state
2. Light theme universal transitions interfered with dropdown visibility
3. Missing self-hover on dropdowns

**Solution:**
1. Replaced `margin-top: 10px` with `top: calc(100% + 5px)` for smaller gap
2. Added invisible bridges (::before pseudo-elements) to maintain hover
3. Excluded dropdowns from light theme transitions
4. Added self-hover to all dropdowns

**Files Modified:**
- `css/items/toolbar/dropdowns.css` - Added bridges, fixed positioning
- `css/items/toolbar/toolbar.css` - Fixed positioning
- `css/items/toolbar/whiteboard-switcher.css` - Added bridge, fixed positioning
- `css/items/toolbar/hamburger.css` - Added bridge
- `css/themes/light.css` - Excluded dropdowns from transitions

**Result:** Dropdowns now reliably stay visible when hovering across all themes.

---

### 2025-08-17: Hamburger Menu Size & Toolbar Position Adjustment (FIXED)
**Change:** Resized hamburger menu and adjusted toolbar position for better spacing.

**Updates:**
- Hamburger button: Changed from 48x48px to 53x53px
- Toolbar position: Moved from left: 80px to left: 95px
- This provides 22px spacing between hamburger (ends at 73px) and toolbar (starts at 95px)

**Files Modified:**
- `css/items/toolbar/hamburger.css` - Updated button dimensions
- `css/items/toolbar/toolbar.css` - Adjusted left position

**Result:** Hamburger menu and toolbar no longer collide, with proper visual spacing.

---

### 2025-08-17: Light Theme Toolbar & Hamburger Menu Styling (FIXED)
**Problem:** Light theme toolbar and hamburger menu had inconsistent styling compared to categories and cards.

**Solution:** Updated light theme to use consistent white background styling:
- Toolbar & hamburger menu: #FFFFFF background with 2px solid #ffffff border
- All text: #5c5c5c color (matching categories/cards)
- Hover states: #E8EBF0 background
- Removed box shadows for clean, minimal look
- Board selector & auth button updated to match

**Files Modified:**
- `css/themes/light.css` - Added comprehensive toolbar and hamburger menu styles

**Result:** Toolbar and hamburger menu now have the same clean white styling as categories and cards.

---

### 2025-08-17: Board Selector & Auth Button CSS Consolidation (FIXED)
**Problem:** Board selector and auth button CSS styles weren't properly organized in the light theme, causing them to be missed during theme edits.

**Root Cause:** Light mode styles were scattered:
- Some light mode styles were at the bottom of whiteboard-switcher.css
- Auth button had no light mode styles at all
- Made maintenance difficult and styles were often missed

**Solution:** Consolidated all board selector and auth button styles into css/themes/light.css:
1. Added comprehensive board selector styles (button, dropdown, hover states)
2. Added complete auth button and modal styles
3. Removed duplicate light mode overrides from whiteboard-switcher.css
4. Left comment in component files pointing to light theme

**Files Modified:**
- `css/themes/light.css` - Added board selector and auth button sections
- `css/items/toolbar/whiteboard-switcher.css` - Removed duplicate light mode styles

**Result:** All light mode styles are now centralized in the light theme file, making them easier to maintain and preventing missed updates.

---

### 2025-08-17: Light Theme Implementation (ADDED)
**Change:** Created comprehensive light theme using specified colors.

**Color Scheme:**
- Primary Background (#F5F7FB): Canvas and cards
- Secondary Background (#FFF): Categories, toolbars, modals
- Text colors: #1A202C (primary), #4A5568 (secondary), #718096 (tertiary)
- Border: #E2E8F0

**Implementation:** Complete light theme covering all UI elements including:
- Canvas and grid with subtle dot pattern
- Categories and cards with proper contrast
- Toolbar and buttons
- Expanded cards and sections
- Bookmarks and editor
- Modals and dialogs
- Context menus and dropdowns

**Files Modified:**
- `css/themes/light.css` - Complete light theme implementation

**Usage:** Select "Light" from the theme dropdown in settings

---

### 2025-08-16: Card Title Container Flex Layout Fix (FIXED)
**Problem:** After expanding and collapsing cards, the icon and title would display side-by-side instead of maintaining the column layout (icon above, title below).

**Root Cause:** The `collapseCard` function was restoring the title directly to the card element instead of back into the `.card-title-container`, breaking the flex column structure.

**Solution:** Modified `collapseCard` to:
1. Check if `.card-title-container` exists
2. If missing, recreate it with the file icon SVG
3. Restore the title into the container (maintaining flex column layout)

**Files Modified:**
- `js/cards.js` - Updated `collapseCard` function to properly restore title container structure

---

### 2025-08-16: Auth Button Moved to Left of Board Selector (MOVED)
**Change:** Moved sign in/out button with email and guest ID to the left of board selector (leftmost position in toolbar).

**Implementation:**
- Modified `addAuthButton()` in auth-ui.js to insert before whiteboard switcher
- Updated auth-button.css margins for leftmost positioning

**Files Modified:**
- `firebase/auth-ui.js` - Changed to `whiteboardSwitcher.insertAdjacentElement('beforebegin', authContainer)`
- `css/items/toolbar/auth-button.css` - Adjusted margins (0 left, 12px right)

---

### 2025-08-16: Card Title and Icon Centering (FIXED)
**Problem:** File SVG icons and card titles needed better centering within cards.

**Solution:**
1. Changed `.card-title` height from `100%` to `min-height: auto` to prevent stretching
2. Added `display: block` and auto margins to `.card-title-icon` for proper centering

**Files Modified:**
- `css/items/widget/cards.css` - Adjusted card-title height
- `css/items/widget/card-title-icon.css` - Added centering for SVG icon

---

### 2025-08-16: Unused CSS Classes Removed (CLEANED UP)
**Change:** Removed all unused CSS classes from classes.css and left file empty.

**Classes removed (none were being used):**
- `.toolbar-button-base` and modifiers
- `.button-small`, `.button-mini`, `.button-compact`
- `.button-transparent`, `.button-save`, `.button-danger`, `.button-active`
- `.button-group`
- `.grid-dot-spacing`

**Files Modified:**
- `css/base/classes.css` - Emptied (all classes were unused)

**Result:** Removed dead code. File left with comment explaining it's intentionally empty.

# Important Notes for Zenban Development

## Critical Issues & Solutions

### 2025-08-16: CSS Variables Removed (REFACTORED)
**Change:** Removed all CSS variables and replaced them with direct values in their respective files.

**Variables replaced:**
- `#131313` for category background (categories.css, cards.css)
- `12px` for border-radius (categories.css)
- `0px` for padding (categories.css)
- `#191919` for canvas background (canvas.css)
- `rgba(255,255,255,0.035)` for grid dots (canvas.css)
- `2px` for dot size, `27px` for grid spacing (canvas.css)

**Files Modified:**
- `css/items/widget/categories.css` - Replaced category variables
- `css/items/widget/cards.css` - Replaced background variable
- `css/canvas/canvas.css` - Replaced canvas/grid variables
- `css/base/classes.css` - Replaced toolbar button and grid variables
- `css/base/variables.css` - Cleared all variables

**Result:** CSS is now simpler without variable indirection. Values are directly in their respective files.

---

### 2025-08-16: Card Edge-to-Edge Padding Fix (FIXED)
**Problem:** Cards had unwanted padding/spacing within categories, preventing them from filling edge-to-edge.

**Root Cause:** Two CSS properties were creating spacing:
1. `--category-base-padding: 18px` in `variables.css` - Added 18px padding around entire category container
2. `gap: 5px` in `.cards-grid` class in `categories.css` - Added 5px gap between cards

**Solution:** 
1. Changed `--category-base-padding` from `18px` to `0px` in `css/base/variables.css`
2. Changed `.cards-grid` gap from `5px` to `0` in `css/items/widget/categories.css`  
3. Added `padding: 0 18px` and `margin-top: 18px` to `.category-header` to maintain header spacing
4. Added `padding: 8px 18px 18px 18px` to `.category-bottom` to maintain bottom spacing

**Files Modified:**
- `css/base/variables.css` - Set category padding to 0
- `css/items/widget/categories.css` - Removed grid gap, adjusted header/bottom padding

**Result:** Cards now fill completely edge-to-edge within categories and touch each other without gaps.

---

### 2025-08-15: Section Selection for Firefox Extension Bookmarks (ADDED)
**Feature:** When adding bookmarks from Firefox extension to expanded cards with multiple sections, users can now choose which section to add the bookmark to.

**Implementation:**
- Modified `bookmark-destination-selector.js` to show section list when expanded card has multiple sections
- First section is selected by default
- Shows section title and bookmark count for each section
- Selected section highlighted in light purple (#e8e8ff)
- Bookmarks added to the selected section's bookmarks array

**Files Modified:** 
- `js/bookmark-destination-selector.js` - Added section selection UI and logic
- `js/cards.js` - Updated comment noting modal override

---

### 2025-08-15: Section Bookmarks Data Loss Issue (FIXED)
**Problem:** Bookmarks disappear after expanding/collapsing cards multiple times (3rd expansion shows 0 bookmarks instead of actual count)

**Root Cause:** In `createSection()` function, when saving sections to AppState, the code was always saving an empty bookmarks array `[]` instead of preserving the actual bookmarks from `sectionData.bookmarks`.

**Symptoms:**
- First expansion: Creates section with correct bookmarks ✓
- Second expansion: Restores section with correct bookmarks ✓  
- Third expansion: Restores section with 0 bookmarks, adds sample bookmark ✗

**Solution:** Fixed 4 locations in cards.js where sections were saved to AppState:
- Line 1465: Changed `bookmarks: []` to `bookmarks: sectionData.bookmarks || []`
- Line 1475: Changed `bookmarks: []` to `bookmarks: sectionData.bookmarks || []`  
- Line 1547: Changed `bookmarks: []` to `bookmarks: sectionData.bookmarks || []`
- Line 1746: Changed `bookmarks: []` to `bookmarks: section.sectionData.bookmarks || []`

**Files Modified:** `js/cards.js`

---

## Recent Refactoring Notes

### AppState Migration
- Recently refactored entire codebase to use centralized AppState
- This caused multiple errors that were slowly corrected
- Be cautious when modifying state management code

---

## Known Issues to Watch

1. **Multiple collapseCard calls** - Function being called 5+ times in quick succession during save operations
2. **Firebase sync timing** - Sections array might be out of sync between local AppState and Firebase
3. **Board sections initialization** - Sometimes `board.sections` is undefined and needs to be initialized as empty array

---

## Code Patterns to Follow

### State Updates
- Always deep copy nested data structures before modifying
- Check if arrays exist before pushing to them
- Use structured logging with emojis for debugging

### File Naming
- Use descriptive, specific names (no generic "utils.js")
- Functions should clearly indicate their purpose
- Comments should be concise and in plain English

---

## Debug Tips

### For Section Issues
1. Check console for `🔍 DEBUG:` logs to trace section creation/restoration
2. Look for `boardSectionsCount` to verify sections are being saved
3. Verify bookmarks array exists in section data before saving
4. Always preserve existing data when updating AppState

### For Bookmark Issues
1. Check `📚 CARD:` logs when cards are restored
2. Verify `📦 SAVE:` logs show correct bookmark counts
3. Check if bookmarks are in `sectionData.bookmarks` not just `card.bookmarks`
4. Ensure deep copies are used when updating nested arrays

---

## Testing Checklist

After making changes to section/bookmark handling:
1. Create a card with bookmarks
2. Expand the card
3. Save and collapse
4. Expand again - verify bookmarks still there
5. Collapse and expand a third time - verify bookmarks persist
6. Refresh page - verify bookmarks load from Firebase
7. Check console logs for any errors or missing data

---

## Important File Locations

- `js/cards.js` - Main card and section management
- `js/boards.js` - Board saving/loading logic
- `js/sync-service.js` - Firebase sync operations
- `js/bookmark-destination-selector.js` - Bookmark modal logic
- `js/extension-bridge.js` - Extension communication

---

### 2025-08-18: Sign Out Button Border on Hover (FIXED)
**Problem:** Sign out button showed a border color change on hover from #202020 to #4a4a4a.

**Solution:** Removed the border-color property from the #signOutBtn:hover rule in auth-button.css to maintain consistent border appearance.

**Files Modified:**
- `css/items/toolbar/auth-button.css` - Removed border-color from hover state

**Result:** Sign out button no longer changes border color on hover.

---

### 2025-08-20: Bookmark Grid Fixed - Always 3 Per Row (FIXED)
**Problem:** Third bookmark was sometimes collapsing to the second row due to incorrect width calculations with flexbox gap.

**Root Cause:** The width calculation `calc(33.333% - 14px)` didn't properly account for the 20px gap between items.

**Solution:**
- Changed gap from 20px to 15px for cleaner math (15px * 2 gaps / 3 items = 10px per item)
- Used `flex: 0 0 calc(33.333% - 10px)` to prevent growing/shrinking
- Added `max-width` to ensure cards never exceed their calculated width
- Added `box-sizing: border-box` to include padding/borders in width calculations

**Implementation Details:**
- **Expanded Card**: Width remains at 1150px for spacious layout
- **Bookmark Cards**: Now use `flex: 0 0 calc(33.333% - 10px)` for reliable 3 per row
- **Gap**: Reduced to 15px for even distribution
- **Box Sizing**: border-box ensures consistent sizing
- **Responsive**: Properly calculated for 2 per row (50% - 7.5px) and 1 per row (100%)

**Files Modified:**
- `css/items/widget/sections.css` - Fixed flex calculations and gap spacing

**Result:** Bookmarks now reliably display exactly 3 per row without any collapsing. The flex-basis approach with proper gap calculations ensures consistent layout regardless of content.

---

### 2025-08-20: Bookmark Descriptions Hidden (SIMPLIFIED)
**Change:** Removed bookmark descriptions from display to create cleaner, more compact bookmark cards.

**Implementation:**
- Set `.bookmark-description` to `display: none` to hide descriptions
- Reduced minimum card height from 240px to 200px since descriptions are no longer shown
- Cards now only display: image/placeholder, title, date, and controls

**Files Modified:**
- `css/items/widget/sections.css` - Added display: none to bookmark descriptions, reduced min-height

**Result:** Bookmark cards are now cleaner and more compact, focusing on the essential information (title and visual). This provides a less cluttered interface and allows more bookmarks to be visible at once.

---

## Remember

- **Always test the third expansion** - This is where bugs often appear
- **Check nested data** - Bookmarks inside sections inside cards inside categories
- **Use proper debugging** - Console logs with emojis help track flow
- **Save incrementally** - Don't wait for perfect solution, save working progress

---

### 2025-08-20: Bookmark Card Component Created (ADDED)
**Feature:** Created a bookmark card with full image background and text overlay.

**Implementation:**
- Created `bookmark-card.html` and `bookmark-card.css` files
- Full background image (philip-martin-5aGUyCW_PJw-unsplash.jpg)
- Card dimensions: 350x450px with 15px border radius
- Bottom overlay with title and description
- Overlay has 5px margin on left, right, and bottom
- Overlay uses white background with backdrop blur

**Files Created:**
- `CSS PLAYFIELD/bookmark-card.html` - HTML structure
- `CSS PLAYFIELD/bookmark-card.css` - Styling

**Result:** Clean bookmark card with image background and text overlay at bottom.
