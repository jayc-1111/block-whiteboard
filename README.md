Js
Structure:
ðŸ“‚ ui/
Break by feature domain + shared components:

ui/
  boards/           â†’ board UI & interactions
    board-view.js
    board-switcher.js
  folders/          â†’ folder UI
    folders.js
    folder-header.js
  files/            â†’ file UIs
    files.js
    file-management.js
    file-helpers.js
    file-extensions.js
  drawing/          â†’ canvas + drawing-specific
    drawing-areas.js
    canvas-drawing.js
    drawing-area-factory.js
  components/       â†’ shared reusable widgets/components
    context-menu.js
    bookmark-move-modal.js
    bookmarks-modal.js
    bookmark-destination-selector.js
  overlays/         â†’ top-level UI layers
    modals/
    notifications/

ðŸ“‚ state/
Keep this focused on data models and in-memory representation:

state/
  app-state.js      â†’ central AppState
  cloud-state.js    â†’ remote/merged copy of state
  board-state.js    â†’ optional: clean board slice extraction
  file-state.js
  folder-state.js

Eventually this lets you model each entity cleanly.

ðŸ“‚ appwrite/
Break into facets of communication:

appwrite/
  api/              â†’ direct thin wrappers over Appwrite SDK
    db.js
    auth.js
    storage.js
  sync/             â†’ sync loops
    appwrite-sync.js
    realtime.js
    conflict-resolver.js
  adapters/         â†’ higher-level domain integrations
    board-adapter.js
    folder-adapter.js
    file-adapter.js
  config/
    appwrite-config.js
    appwrite-utils.js
    appwrite-setup.js
    database-setup.js
    database-recovery.js

That gives you layers for direct SDK use (api), orchestration (sync), and domain-specific mapping (adapters).

ðŸ“‚ constants/
Just one flat directory:

constants/
  index.js         â†’ export everything
  grid.js
  ui.js
  appwrite.js      â†’ collection names, field keys

âœ… Why this works
ui aligns with screens/features â†’ easy for frontend contributors.
state stays minimal, domain-specific â†’ clean separation between in-memory truth and persistence.
appwrite groups all persistence concerns but separates raw SDK calls from sync orchestration.
constants stays clean and domain-scoped.
