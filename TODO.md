# TODO List for Nested Tree Items Height Issue

## Investigation
- [x] Check CSS files for height-related styles
- [x] Check file-tree.css for nested item styles
- [x] Check files.css for any conflicting styles
- [x] Check file-tree.js for any JavaScript that might affect height
- [x] Check index.html for any inline styles

## Analysis
- [x] Identified that the issue is likely related to the recent change from "card" to "file"
- [x] Found that bookmark-file.css has specific height definitions that might be affecting tree items
- [x] Identified that tree items are inheriting styles from the .file class in files.css

## Solution
- [x] Fix the CSS rule that's causing nested tree items to have 260px height
- [x] Fix the CSS rules that are causing tree item icons to inherit file styles
- [x] Test the fix to ensure tree items display correctly
