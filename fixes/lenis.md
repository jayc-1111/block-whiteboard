# Lenis Smooth Scroll Solution for Modals and Expanded Files

## Problem
Lenis smooth scrolling was not working properly in modals and expanded files. The scrolling behavior was conflicting with the main whiteboard scrolling, causing issues with nested scrollable areas.

## Solution Overview
Implemented proper scroll isolation for modals and expanded files using the `data-lenis-prevent` attribute and custom Lenis instances for modal content.

## Changes Made

### 1. CSS Updates (`css/scripts/lenis-smooth-scroll.css`)
- Added styles to handle elements with `data-lenis-prevent` attribute
- Ensured proper overscroll behavior for modal content

### 2. JavaScript Updates (`js/files/files.js`)
- Added `data-lenis-prevent` attribute to the main content area in expanded files
- Implemented a custom Lenis instance for modal scrolling
- Added `reinitializeModalLenis` function to handle dynamic content changes
- Integrated Lenis reinitialization with bookmark operations (add, remove, reorder)

### 3. Modal Scrolling Implementation
- Each expanded file now gets its own Lenis instance for internal scrolling
- The modal Lenis instance is destroyed when the file is collapsed
- The modal Lenis instance is reinitialized when content changes (adding sections, bookmarks, etc.)

## Technical Details

### Data Attribute Approach
The solution uses the `data-lenis-prevent` attribute on scrollable modal elements to prevent Lenis from interfering with their native scrolling behavior.

### Custom Lenis Instances
Each modal gets its own Lenis instance with specific configuration:
```javascript
const modalLenis = new Lenis({
    wrapper: modalWrapper,
    content: modalContent,
    lerp: 0.1,
    duration: 1.2,
    smoothWheel: true,
    wheelMultiplier: 1,
    touchMultiplier: 1.2,
});
```

### Dynamic Content Handling
The `reinitializeModalLenis` function ensures that Lenis scrolling continues to work properly when:
- New sections are added
- Bookmarks are added/removed/reordered
- Content is dynamically updated

## Benefits
1. Smooth scrolling works independently in modals and the main whiteboard
2. No conflicts between different scrollable areas
3. Proper handling of dynamic content updates
4. Maintains performance with proper cleanup of Lenis instances
5. Follows Lenis best practices for nested scrollable areas

## Testing
The solution has been tested with:
- Expanding/collapsing files
- Adding/removing sections
- Adding/removing/reordering bookmarks
- Editor content changes
- Dark mode toggling
